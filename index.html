        <h2>Hi! I'm Joey Spencer</h2>
    <p>I am a software engineer living in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>
    <p>While studying to be a software engineer, I've picked up a few 
        skills. Such as:</p>
    <!-- Unordered list -->
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript.</li>
            <li>CSS.</li>
            <li>HTML.</li>
        </ul><br>

    <h2>About Joey</h2>
    <p>After graduating high school, I began experimenting with JavaScript
        and HTML. This passion led me to wanting to learn about this subject and 
        to make it my career.</p>
        <br>
    <p>I later signed up for a Full Stack Javascript course on Treehouse.com 
        and that is when I knew that this line of work was perfect for me. Other 
        things that I am interested in are movies, fishing, and camping!

    <br>
    <p>Now that I am a student at Thinkful, I've never been more prepared
        to express my skills as a software engineer.
