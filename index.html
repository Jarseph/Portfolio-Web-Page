    <h2>About Joey</h2>
    <p>After graduating high school, I began experimenting with JavaScript
        and HTML. This passion led me to wanting to learn about this subject and 
        to make it my career.</p>
        <br>
    <p>I later signed up for a Full Stack Javascript course on Treehouse.com 
        and that is when I knew that this line of work was perfect for me.

    <p>Now that I am a student at Thinkful, I've never been more prepared
        to express my skills as a software engineer.
